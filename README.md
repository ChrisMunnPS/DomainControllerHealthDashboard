## Technical Overview

This script performs a comprehensive health check across all domain controllers in an Active Directory forest. It includes:

- **Ping validation** to confirm DC availability  
- **DCDiag parsing** to extract test results and failure details  
- **System error log analysis** from the past 24 hours  
- **Health scoring** per DC based on pass/fail ratios  
- **Failure summaries** with detailed diagnostics  

### Output

- **HTML Report**: Dark-themed, tech-styled dashboard with color-coded results  
- **Markdown Report**: Lightweight, portable summary for documentation or GitHub display  
- Both reports are saved to the same directory where the script is executed, timestamped for audit clarity.

# Run the script with admin privileges
.\ADHealthDashboard.ps1
```


Requirements
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- RSAT: Active Directory module installed
